# estimating-delivery-time
I have completed my new statistical modeling project for Olist, a Brazil-based e-commerce giant, analyzing over 100,000 order data points and predicting the estimated delivery date.

 When I converted the exponential coefficients I obtained into business intelligence metrics, I got findings about the logistics network:
 Having the customer and seller in different states increases delivery time by an average of 80% (1.8 times).

 Although the effect of shipping cost and product physical characteristics (weight/volume) on delivery time is statistically significant, in practical terms it is very weak compared to geographical distance.
